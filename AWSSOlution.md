# Proposed AWS Deployment Approach for FastAPI Weather API

---

## 1. API Deployment

We might consider using **Amazon ECS with Fargate** to run our FastAPI application as containerized services. It could be beneficial for us to store our Dockerized FastAPI image in **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)** for easy retrieval and management. Setting up an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** in front of our ECS service may help us securely expose the API and effectively manage incoming HTTP(S) traffic.

For security and networking, deploying ECS tasks within a **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** in private subnets, while placing the ALB in public subnets, might be a good practice. We could manage access with appropriate security groups. Additionally, injecting runtime environment variables—such as our database connection string—through ECS task definitions, possibly sourcing secrets from **AWS Secrets Manager**, could enhance security and configuration management.

## 2. Database Hosting

Hosting our database backend on **Amazon RDS with PostgreSQL** could provide a managed, scalable, and resilient solution. It would be advisable to locate our RDS instance in private subnets within the same VPC as our ECS tasks, ensuring secure and low-latency connectivity. Using **AWS Secrets Manager** to manage credentials and connecting our API via securely injected environment variables may be beneficial for protecting sensitive information.

## 3. Scheduled Data Ingestion

For running our ingestion process on a schedule, we might explore setting up **AWS Fargate Scheduled Tasks** triggered by **Amazon EventBridge** rules. Defining an ECS Task Definition that runs our ingestion logic (via the existing CLI `ingest` command) and configuring EventBridge to trigger it on our desired schedule—daily, for example—could automate the process smoothly. Monitoring logs and task status through **Amazon CloudWatch Logs** may offer improved observability.

## Potential Benefits of This Approach

- ECS Fargate could allow our containers to scale automatically based on demand.
- Managed services like RDS might reduce operational overhead by handling patching, backups, and failover.
- Employing Secrets Manager along with a private network setup may strengthen our security posture.
- EventBridge scheduled tasks might enable efficient, serverless automation of our data ingestion without maintaining dedicated servers.
- Using CloudWatch for monitoring and alerting can provide valuable insights and proactive issue detection.
